The python scripts require some packages to run. You may not require to run the file.
All you need to see is the csv output files.

You will get a serires of aadhar card numbers followed by the url.

I have considered one URL result.

For multiple URL's, the result would be the same like:


aadhar numbers in 1st row for 1st URL
URL
Aadhar numbers in 2nd row for 2nd URL
2nd URL
.

.


A graph should be showing the no of aadhars/pan/etc found against the url. When the graph is clicked, it should redirect to the 
URL.
